To assist interaction of determining the colour range, a sample colour 'Swatch' is referenced.\n","\n","The Swatch may be a small cropped area from a target image, a composite of selected target pixel spreads, or a generated colour gradient.\n","\n","When the Colour Picker is run, positive image results will be returned with bounding boxes marked. Bounding box extents as image co-ordinates are also output as text.\n","\n","Colour ranges can be assessed in either RGB or HSV colour spaces. For the swatch to determine the range, it is first subject to clustering, establishing a majority colour spread, then the calculated spread is bracketed. (Defaulting to two bands of clustering as foreground vs background and retaining 98% spread of the majority band.)\n","\n","Colour Picking and range extraction from Swatches can be chained into a single automated run or can be run as distinct processes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"EGsax5a5-9SF"},"outputs":[],"source":["# --- Initialisation ----\n","\n","# Imports \n","import requests \n","import json\n","import time\n","from getpass import getpass\n","import ipywidgets as widgets\n","\n","# For dev, allow refresh of support lib\n","import importlib\n","\n","import ASDC_API_support\n","importlib.reload(ASDC_API_support)\n","print(\"Lib loaded\")\n","\n","# Useful links to remember\n","site_url = \"https://dev2pi.sswp.cosinecrm.com.au\"\n","base_url = site_url + \"/sswpapps-api/\"\n","auth_url = base_url + \"auth\"\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3e0yo6HsIf7h"},"source":["# Establish API authorisation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GDbXQh5y_C83"},"source":["## Setup your ASDC user access\n","\n","1. go to https://dev2pi.sswp.cosinecrm.com.au\n","2. log in to your SSWP account \n","3. go to SSWP Apps > Manage account\n","4. set an App password using the Update Password interface in the middle of the screen\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o0K2SIFQg3aO"},"source":["## Obtain a token for API access\n","1. go to https://dev2pi.sswp.cosinecrm.com.au/sswpapps-api/auth\n","2. log in with your ASDC user name and password\n","3. copy out the token, and paste it into the following cell as a string\n","4.
